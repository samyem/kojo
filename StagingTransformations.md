Some initial thoughts on transformations...

### Types of Transformations ###
  * Rotation (about stage origin or object origin).
  * Scaling (about stage origin or object origin).
  * Translation.


### Different Kinds of Transformations ###
  * Transformations of individual shapes.
  * Transformations of the _Stage_, so that everything drawn on it gets transformed.
  * Transformations of the _Stage_, so that everything drawn to it in the future gets transformed.

#### Currently checked in functionality ####
  * Translation of Shapes
  * Rotation of Shapes about stage origin - (0, 0)
  * Scaling of Shapes about stage origin - (0, 0)
